You can expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays which either answers your question, or to set up a further meeting to discuss your request. You, in turn, are also expected to check your university email and our Canvas course regularly and respond in a timely manner.    Course Prerequisites  MATH 340 or MATH 345    Course Materials    Textbook  We will use the free open-source text Introduction to Partial Differential Equations by Russell Herman. You are also encouraged to download a PDF copy .  The chapters in the PDF are not in the same order as the HTML, but contains the same content. While the HTML version is easier to navigate, I have found some typos and omissions in the HTML version that are corrected in the PDF version. Therefore, it may work best to use these in conjunction with one another.    Canvas  We will use Canvas to organize grades and resources and to send whole class announcements. Canvas can be accessed using your Colorado State University email, and should be checked for communications at least once each week day.    We are invested in making all course materials as accessible as possible, and are committed to the University's accessibility statement . If you experience any barriers to access, please communicate with me (email, call, or stop by in person) so that we can make improvements.    Course Content and Structure  According to the course catalog, this course covers Partial differential equations, separation of variables, Fourier series and transforms, Laplace, heat and wave equations. . These broad topics boil down to investigating where partial differential equations (PDEs) come from, how PDEs are classified (which corresponds to underlying physical phenomena and the resulting behavior of solutions), and how PDEs can be solved analytically.  It turns out that PDEs commonly appear when we want to mathematically describe things that can be considered continua: how does a fluid flow, how does a solid deform, how is heat transported within a body? This is important in gaining an intuition about PDEs and their solutions because many of the mathematical properties are obviously true if you consider what the PDE describes, even if the proof may not be trivial.  Like most practical ODEs, PDEs can in general not be solved on a piece of paper by just deriving a formula for the solution. This is particularly true if you want a closed-form formula for the solution, but in reality, in almost all cases, we can not even write the solution as infinite sums that can be evaluated. However, there are important cases where this can be done, and we will cover these cases because they give us insight into more general solution approaches (analytic or numeric) and because this is one way to prove properties of solutions (such as smoothness or regularity).     Assignments, Assessments, and Grades   Homework  Working exercises and asking questions is an important way to engage in our course content. Exercises will be assigned and due bi-weekly, typically due on Fridays of even weeks before our class meetings.  Making mistakes and correcting them is also an important part of the learning process. Therefore, if you make appropriate effort and submit work by the due date, there may corrections opportunities offered for your work. Details of the corrections process will be discussed in class, when available.    Midterm  The midterm is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 11, in class.   In general, makeup midterms will not be considered, unless you have a University excused absence. We will also consider requests from student case management.     Final  The final exam is scheduled for Wednesday, May 13 from 7:30am -- 9:30am, in our normal classroom.  The final will be cumulative, split into two sections corresponding to content covered on the midterm and content not covered on the midterm. We know that it can take time to learn new concepts. Therefore, if your percentage score in the first section exceeds your score on the midterm, we will replace the midterm score with your section score from the final.    Grades  Overall grade percentages will be calculated based on the following weighting:  Homework ( )  Midterm ( )  Final ( )    Letter grades will be assigned according to a scale no stricter than the following:   A     B     C     D     F         Tentative Schedule  Below is a tentative schedule for what topics will be covered when.

Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which are described and linked. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are comfortable in doing so.    Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion  Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at the catalog and at the SRC .  We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.  Here are several resources that highlight the past and current contributions to the mathematics community from underrepresented groups:   Meet A Mathematician    Mathematically Gifted and Black    Lathisms    Indigenous Mathematicians    Spectra    Association for Women in Mathematics    Mathematicians of the African Diaspora       Accommodation for Disabilities  If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class due to a disability or chronic health condition, I will need an accommodation letter from the Student Disability Center (SDC) before they are implemented. Please meet with me during my office hours to give me the letter and\/or to further discuss your needs.  If you do not already have these letters, please contact the SDC as soon as possible to initiate the accommodation process. The SDC is located in room 121 of the TILT building. Contact them at 970-491-6385 or visit the SDC website .    Student Parents\/Guardians\/Caregivers  I realize that student parents\/guardians and caregivers face distinctive challenges in succeeding academically, and I'm committed to supporting those of you who are parents to achieve our course's learning outcomes. If you encounter challenges in meeting course expectations, please contact me as soon as possible. We'll develop a plan together so you can be successful in the course.    Student Case Management   Student case management is available to help students with extenuating life circumstances and connect them with resources. In some cases, after you and I discuss your situation, I may request verifiable documentation for class absences from the SCM office if you request considerations for absences or missed coursework.    Mental Health and Wellness  CSU is a community that cares. You are not alone. CSU Health Network Counseling Services has trained professionals who can help. Your student fees provide access to a wide range of support services. Call Counseling Services at (970) 491-6053, and they will work together with you to find out which services are right for you. Visit counseling services to learn more and mental health resources for additional student mental health and well-being resources. If you are concerned about a friend or peer, use Tell Someone by c alling (970) 491-1350 or visiting Tell Someone to share your concerns with a professional who can discreetly connect the distressed individual with the proper resources. Rams Take Care of Rams. Reach out and ask for help if you or someone you know is having a difficult time.    Religious Observances and Class Attendance  CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at the catalog .    Discrimination and Harassment  CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.  Details regarding what is involved in bringing a complaint and the procedures for informal and formal resolution are available from the Office of Support and Safety Assessment for student-to-student behavior and the Office of Equal Opportunity for matters involving non-students such as faculty, staff, affiliates, or visitors and matters involving a student and non-student person. See more details at the catalog .    Academic Integrity and the Honor Code  We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself \"Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?\" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously, so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.  This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at the catalog and TILT .    Syllabus Disclaimer  Please be aware that this syllabus is a guideline and is subject to change. The instructor reserves the right to make adjustments to the course schedule, assignments, and grading policies as deemed necessary. Students will be notified of any changes in a timely manner.    "

    <title>Homework</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your final homework submissions should be a professional-looking product that demonstrates significant 
        effort in arriving at solutions, and thoughtfulness in how that solution is organized and presented. While collaboration
        with your peers is allowed and encouraged, your final write-up should be done individually without consulting others. Therefore, 
        your final solutions should not closely resemble someone else's, or a solution that is on the internet or in a book. Refer to 
        <url href="https://jshriner6.github.io/math332-SP2026/syllabus/syllabus.html#sec-policies-10">the syllabus statement on Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</url>
        for how we will handle cases of academic dishonesty.

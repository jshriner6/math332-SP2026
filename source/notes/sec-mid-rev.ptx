                    The following conceptual questions are intended to help you review important ideas covered on midterm 1.
                    You should use them, along with homework questions and class examples, to guide your studying and creation
                    of a single note sheet that can be used during the in-class midterm.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                What is the order of a PDE, and why is it important?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                What does it mean for a first-order PDE to be linear? semilinear? quasilinear?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Describe the main tools we've discussed for solving first-order equations. When
                                can each be used? How do we utilize tools from ODEs?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                What is the advection equation? Why is it not necessary to consider the breaking time
                                in this context?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                What is the general transport equation? Why is it necessary to consider the breaking time 
                                in this context?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                               How can we visualize the breaking time for a solution to the transport equation?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                What is a common approach to solving second-order linear PDEs? Describe the general process.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                How can we determine what data is necessary to find a particular solution to a second order
                                linear PDE (for example, do we need boundary conditions? initial conditions? how many?)?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                How do we classify second order PDEs? In what ways is this useful?
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

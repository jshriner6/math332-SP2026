          <title>Course Content and Structure</title>
          <p>
            According to the course catalog, this course covers <q>Partial differential equations, separation of variables, Fourier series and transforms, 
              Laplace, heat and wave equations.</q>. 
           These broad topics boil down to investigating where partial differential equations (PDEs) come from,
           how PDEs are classified (which corresponds to underlying physical phenomena and
           the resulting behavior of solutions), and how PDEs can be solved analytically.
            </p>
            <p>
           It turns
    out that PDEs commonly appear when we want to mathematically
    describe things that can be considered continua: how does a fluid
    flow, how does a solid deform, how is heat transported within a
    body? This is important in gaining an intuition about PDEs and
    their solutions because many of the mathematical properties are
    obviously true if you consider what the PDE describes, even if
    the proof may not be trivial.
            </p>
            <p>
  
Like most practical ODEs,
    PDEs can in general not be solved on a piece of paper by just
    deriving a formula for the solution. This is particularly
    true if you want a closed-form formula for the solution, but in
    reality, in almost all cases, we can not even write the solution as infinite sums that
    can be evaluated. However, there are important
    cases where this can be done, and we will cover these
    cases because they give us insight into more general solution
    approaches (analytic or numeric) and because this is one way to
    prove properties of solutions (such as smoothness or regularity).

        <p>
          Working exercises and asking questions is an important way to engage in our course content. Exercises will be assigned 
          and due weekly, typically on Fridays before our class meetings. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Making mistakes and correcting them is also an important part of the learning process. Therefore, if you make appropriate
          effort and submit work by the due date, there may corrections opportunities offered for your work. Details of the corrections
          process will be discussed in class, when available.

          <title>Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion</title>
          <p>
              Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. 
              Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and 
              sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, 
              color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and 
              gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the 
              student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. 
              Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. 
              For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at 
              <url href="https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/policies/students-responsibilities/">the catalog</url> 
              and at <url href="https://resolutioncenter.colostate.edu/conduct/">the SRC</url>.

          <p>
              We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of 
              mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. 
              We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you 
              can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are 
              committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the 
              hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, 
              and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.

          <title>Religious Observances and Class Attendance</title>
          <p>
          CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, 
          it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each 
          semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students 
          will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how 
          best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be 
          anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the 
          course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple 
          conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer 
          taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may 
          appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure 
          compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at

          <title>Discrimination and Harassment</title>
          <p>
              CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. 
              CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that 
              each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations 
              such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are 
              prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, 
              domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under 
              the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having 
              business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.

          <title>Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</title>
          <p>
              We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. 
              However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if 
              you crossed the line, ask yourself "Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look 
              like this?" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements 
              from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously,
              so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.
          </p>
